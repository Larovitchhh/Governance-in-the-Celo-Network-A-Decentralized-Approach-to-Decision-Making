In July 2024, the Celo community voted to transition from a Layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer-2 network using Optimism’s OP Stack. This decision, finalized in March 2025, was a significant governance milestone, demonstrating the community’s ability to enact major protocol changes. The transition enhances transaction speed and reduces costs while maintaining Celo’s mobile-first focus and features like SocialConnect, which links phone numbers or X handles to wallet addresses.
