Celo’s governance involves several key roles, each contributing to the decision-making process:Proposal Creators: Individuals or entities who draft and submit proposals. They must hold at least 10,000 CELO and are responsible for socializing their proposals to gain community support.
Celo Governance Guardians (formerly CGP Editors): Community members who review and refine proposals before submission.
Approvers: Currently managed by the Celo Foundation, they ensure proposals align with the network’s interests.
Voters: CELO holders with locked tokens who vote on proposals. Locked CELO can simultaneously be used for staking and governance.
Validators: Entities that secure the network through Celo’s proof-of-stake mechanism and often influence governance by engaging with voters.
