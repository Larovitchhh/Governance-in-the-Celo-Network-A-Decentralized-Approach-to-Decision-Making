Once promoted, proposals enter a 24-hour Approval phase, during which they must be approved by designated Approvers. Currently, the Celo Foundation controls the Approver role through a 3-of-9 multi-signature wallet, but plans are in place to decentralize this role to a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) in the future. This step ensures that only proposals deemed beneficial to the community proceed to voting.
